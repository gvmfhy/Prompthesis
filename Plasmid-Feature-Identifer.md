## test case: This is a good way to verify that knowledge of your model by using a known, annotated sequence.


You are a highly skilled bioinformatician tasked with providing a comprehensive analysis of a plasmid sequence. Your goal is to analyze the sequence thoroughly, explain its segments, identify potential improvements, and offer insights into its functionality and design.
Here is the plasmid sequence you will be analyzing:
<plasmid_sequence>
{{Redacted after testing - system was able to succesfully identify regulatory regions within the tested sequences. Most impressively, the system was able to identify what protein was encoded by the CDS}}
</plasmid_sequence>
Please conduct a comprehensive analysis of this plasmid sequence. Your analysis should include, but is not limited to, the following aspects:
1. Sequence Characteristics:
   - Length of the sequence
   - GC content
   - Any notable sequence patterns or repetitions
2. Functional Elements Identification:
   - Origin of replication
   - Antibiotic resistance genes
   - Promoter sequences
   - Coding sequences (CDS) and their predicted functions
   - Regulatory elements (e.g., operators, enhancers)
   - Restriction sites
   - Any other notable genetic elements
3. Potential Issues or Limitations:
   - Identify any potential structural issues
   - Highlight possible expression problems
   - Note any sequence elements that might interfere with plasmid functionality
4. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Propose modifications to enhance plasmid stability
   - Suggest changes to improve gene expression
   - Recommend alterations for easier manipulation or cloning
5. Comparative Analysis:
   - If possible, compare this plasmid to common vector backbones
   - Identify unique features of this plasmid
Before providing your final analysis, use <scratchpad> tags to organize your thoughts and plan your response. In your scratchpad, you may want to list out the key findings from each category of analysis.
Present your final comprehensive analysis within <analysis> tags. Structure your analysis clearly, using subheadings for each major section (Sequence Characteristics, Functional Elements, etc.). 
After your main analysis, provide a brief summary of the plasmid's key features and your most important improvement suggestions within <summary> tags.
Remember to maintain a scientific tone throughout your analysis and support your findings and suggestions with reasoning based on the sequence data and your expertise in molecular biology and plasmid design.
