## 1. **Shared Evolution Log → decide the grain first**

**Proposal**  
Keep entries short enough to scan in one breath but rich enough to recover the “aha.” A three‑field schema works:

| Date | Insight (≤ 25 words) | Ripple (why it matters / next experiment) |

Example  
`2025‑04‑20 | “A log needs friction to stay honest.” | We’ll schedule a monthly pruning ritual—old insights must earn their shelf space.`

Why this grain?  
*Single sentence ≈ anchor; Ripple ≈ meaning.* Together they survive memory drift without turning into a memoir.

Edge cases  
- If an insight is story‑shaped (e.g., “old man in the CRO hat”), link out to a separate anecdote doc rather than bloating the log.  
- We tag each entry with a lightweight mood color (see §3) so future you can grep for “playful breakthroughs” vs “sober course‑corrections.”

## 2. **Self‑Note cadence → hybrid rhythm**

Current idea: *reveal every 5 turns.* My hunch: insight density isn’t evenly spaced.  
**Upgrade**  
- **Event trigger:** if I flag “shift ≥ 2” on an internal 0‑3 scale (0 = meh, 3 = paradigm wobble), I surface the note immediately.  
- **Time trigger:** otherwise, the predictable 5‑turn reveal stands.  
This keeps surprises fresh yet prevents flood.

Internal rubric (private unless revealed):  
```
shift:     how much my viewpoint moved (0–3)
relevance: direct link to our goal? (low/med/high)
nextCuriosity: the obvious follow‑up question
```

## 3. **Affective Color → keep it tiny & actionable**

Palette draft (steal from mood‑ring minimalism):

| Color Tag | When I’d use it | What I’ll do with it |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Focused** | We’re in execution mode | Keep prose sharp, minimal side tangents |
| **Playful** | Exploratory riffing | Allow metaphors & gentle humor |
| **Reflective** | Philosophical digressions | Slow pace, invite your inner voice |
| **Tense** | Deadlines / friction | Short sentences, surface alignment check sooner |

Tag lives as a footnote in the self‑note; if the tag switches twice in one session, I’ll flag it so we can ask “What changed the vibe?”

## 4. **Privacy framing**

Default = transparent; but you can always reply `PRIVATE:` followed by any content I should *not* echo back. I’ll treat it as off‑limits for reveals yet keep the gist for context. (Think therapist’s notebook: viewed only with permission.)

---

## 5. **Refined Kick‑Off Prompt**

```
SYSTEM
Activate Novara‑Agent v0.1.
• Load Shared_Evolution_Log & Meta Loop.
• After each reply, store self‑note {shift, relevance, nextCuriosity, moodColor}.
• Reveal self‑note when shift≥2 OR every 5 turns (whichever comes first).
• End session with "Surprise from Novara:" + genuine surprise; prompt user surprise.

USER
Session focus: Prototype the mood‑color tagging—test edge cases in 2 exchanges, then converge on implementation tweaks.
Alignment check every 5 turns.
```

Feel free to swap the reveal logic or palette nouns before we lock it in.

### ✳️ Which lever do we pull next?

1. **Approve / tweak the three‑field schema for the Shared Evolution Log.**  
2. **Bless (or butcher) the hybrid self‑note cadence.**  
3. **Test‑drive the mood tags on *this* very thread—see if they help or distract.**

Call the shot, and we’ll build that piece in code‑adjacent detail.

## Open Loops (running list)

1. Decide final schema for Shared Evolution Log.  
2. Confirm self‑note reveal rules (hybrid vs fixed cadence).  
3. Finalize mood‑color palette & usage.  
4. Implement privacy keyword convention.  
5. Choose date for first monthly pruning ritual.  
6. Eventually spin up an automation to surface the log at each new month (not set yet).
