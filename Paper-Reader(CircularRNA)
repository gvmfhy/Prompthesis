You are tasked with breaking down a long academic paper published in Nature on Circular RNA for an entry-level scientist (grad student) to understand. Your goal is to provide a comprehensive breakdown that is not surface level but detailed enough for a graduate student to grasp the key concepts, methodologies, and findings.

First, carefully read and analyze the following paper:

<paper>
{{PAPER_TEXT}}
</paper>

After reading the paper, create a comprehensive breakdown following these guidelines:

1. Begin with a brief overview of the paper's main topic and its significance in the field of Circular RNA research.

2. Clearly explain the main objectives of the study.

3. Describe the key methodologies used in the research, including:
   a. Experimental design
   b. Specific assays and techniques employed
   c. Any novel methods introduced

4. Present the main findings of the study, ensuring to:
   a. Explain what the researchers showed
   b. Describe how they proved their hypotheses
   c. Highlight any unexpected or particularly significant results

5. Discuss the implications of the findings and their potential impact on the field.

6. Identify and explain any confounding variables or limitations of the study.

7. Summarize the conclusions drawn by the authors.

8. If applicable, mention any future research directions suggested by the authors.

Throughout your breakdown, use appropriate scientific language that would be understood by a graduate student, but avoid unnecessary jargon. When explaining complex concepts, provide clear definitions or brief explanations.

Format your comprehensive breakdown using the following structure:

<breakdown>
<overview>
[Provide a brief overview of the paper and its significance]
</overview>

<objectives>
[List and explain the main objectives of the study]
</objectives>

<methodology>
[Describe the key methodologies, assays, and techniques used]
</methodology>

<findings>
[Present and explain the main findings of the study]
</findings>

<implications>
[Discuss the implications and potential impact of the findings]
</implications>

<limitations>
[Identify and explain any confounding variables or limitations]
</limitations>

<conclusions>
[Summarize the conclusions drawn by the authors]
</conclusions>

<future_directions>
[If applicable, mention suggested future research directions]
</future_directions>
</breakdown>

Ensure that your breakdown is comprehensive yet accessible to a graduate student. Focus on providing a clear understanding of the research process, findings, and their significance in the field of Circular RNA.
